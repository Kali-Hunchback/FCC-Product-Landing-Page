# Free Code Camp Product Landing Page Project
Project undertaken as a part of FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification<br>
**Project 3 of 5**<br>
I learnt a lot from this project, including a very basic understanding of flex-box, I hope to use it more, but also need to be able understand grid in order to use both in conjunction to full effect
## User Stories
1. My product landing page should have a header element with a corresponding id="header".

1. I can see an image within the header element with a corresponding id="header-img". A company logo would make a good image here.

1. Within the #header element I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="nav-bar".

1. I can see at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class nav-link.

1. When I click a .nav-link button in the nav element, I am taken to the corresponding section of the landing page.

1. I can watch an embedded product video with id="video".

1. My landing page has a form element with a corresponding id="form".

1. Within the form, there is an input field with id="email" where I can enter an email address.

1. The #email input field should have placeholder text to let the user know what the field is for.

1. The #email input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address.

1. Within the form, there is a submit input with a corresponding id="submit".

1. When I click the #submit element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit).
